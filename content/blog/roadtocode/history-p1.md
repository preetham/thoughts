## Beginnings

I had a fascination for computers and computer games from my childhood, pretty much glued to a computer at any friend's place playing games (much to the disdain of my parents). After my behaviour got pretty annoying, my parents got me a computer; a Compaq pre-built PC with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU inside. This was pre-broadband days in India where dial up was the only option and the PC didn't even have a dial up modem. There was a "computer center" guy who came in and figured that out, fixed us up with a dial up modem, giving us internet access for the first time in our lives, a blazing speed of 48Kbps with a disclaimer: regular phone calls cannot be made when connected to Internet. After a year or so broadband was available with speeds upto 1Mbps zapak.com, miniclip.com were my life. I was allowed to play on it only on weekends much to my disappointment but I had a good time.

In a year of playing around with the computer, I figured out how to install an OS: tried to upgrade Windows XP to Windows Vista, couldn't even get hands on a valid copy of Windows Vista for atleast a year (I lived in a rural village where having a computer itself was a luxury, only 3 other classmates had them). Burning CDs/DVDs was a big thing, Nero was a must have in every computer, backups of our memories were made to these CDs which still exist today in some condition. I figured out that driver installation was necessary for the computer to run (it was done via CDs at that time). I used Windows Movie Maker which came bundled with other Windows Live Essentials software (Messenger, Photo Gallery, Mail, Writer) to edit some home videos. I learnt how to convert videos to other formats using software such as Any Video Converter for playing them on mobile (only 3gp format was supported in those old Nokia phones).
I lived in such a bubble that I never heard of Linux or a Mac during that time. Games I played during that time ranged from online games such as Sewer Run, Commando 2 to AAA games such as GTA San Andreas. For any AAA games, we have to borrow from other friends who had them since the nearest store was around 150km.

The only academic usage for the computer was programming in Cpp and Java. I had Computer Applications as a subject during school days, course work included theory about computer parts as well as programming in Java. The teachers taught us some basics about programming and syntax of Java. Problems included sorting, operations on linked lists etc. though we were never taught anything indepth (such as time complexity or space complexity). There were a range of problems we could get in the final board exams and all we did was practice some variations of the problems. I was quite good at it, liked the aspect of solving different mathematical problems on a computer instead of doing them manually. Also, computers exam was an excuse to switch on the computer and play some games.

## Decision Time

After spending two years toiling through JEE preparation, I finally qualified, I got an opportunity to choose the stream I would want to pursue further. At this point of time, I assumed I would be good at Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) since I was good at 10th grade Computer Applications (naive thought but I liked solving problems). I could not pursue Computers as a subject during my 11th and 12th grade as it wasn't available, maybe that would have helped make a better decision. I chose CSE as my stream for my undergraduation, not knowing what lied ahead in front of me. With all the enthusiasm, I joined IIT Guwahati where I was greeted with a year of unnecessary (in my honest opinion) charade of courses from other streams which I never actually got around to use in my curriculum again.

The enthusiasm died off pretty soon and a big revelation dawned upon me about Computer Science: it was full of Mathematics. I never was bad at Mathematics, but I needed to be super good at it if I wanted to survive. Students who had some exposure already had either learnt about ComSci beforehand thereby dominating the classroom or were quick to grasp the mathematical concepts required for getting through the courses. I had neither of it, didn't find the right group to learn about it nor put in the work to understand what was being taught, flunked courses and somehow passed by redoing them again.

## The Why

I have couple of abilities: I can very quickly grasp things, have a very good visual memory. There is a t&c apply astriesk to the first ability: it must either pick my curiosity or I should atleast understand why I was learning what I was trying to learn. When it came to course work, simple theory never motivated me enough. I like learning, make something pracitical out of it and watch it result in some sort of usefulness. Just because it was part of course work, didn't actually motivate me enough to take part of it. Part of the discouragement is the speed at which I learn if I don't find it interesting. I tend to understand things at a slower pace some concepts which put me at a disadvantage in a classroom thereby demotivating me to focus further on the subject.

Data Structures and Algorithms is one such subject, I couldn't actually understand the why for it and put me in a spiral of less confidence, no work put in to understand it and eventually flunking the course altogether. I cleared it later but I could never learn it or be good at it on a level my peers were. One good thing that happened during college is Google Summer of Code (GSoC), it's an annual open source contribution programme over a period of 2-3 months sponsored by Google. Its motive is to encourage open source contributions among the student fraternity. Even though I was bad at DSA, I learnt how to program for solving simple real world problems mainly in Javascript and Python both interpreted languages which suited my style of just executing simple pieces on the fly. One such example is:
- I had a huge set of photos in a directory each one with the timestamp of capture as it's filename. I wanted to create a directory structure based on the year + month and move all those files accordingly (executed on Python).

All these simple attempts got me back into programming, which helped me bag a spot in [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/4536824152195072/). It was a result of a couple of things:
- A fresh problem statement with no dependencies on any previous course work, I could attempt it with a fresh state of mind.
- The problem was to be solved in Javascript, a language I was already familiar with.
- An incredibly supportive mentor in the form of [Bruno Bottazzini](https://github.com/brunobottazzini) from Intel Brazil.

When campus placements got around, I prepared a little: arrays and linked lists, luckily one of the companies only asked about linked lists, I got through the coding round somehow. Interview was a breeze as it was based on my past projects which I could explain well and GSoC on the CV was already a good impression.

Its been almost 4 years working, I have changed couple of companies always somehow getting through DSA rounds and excelling at other rounds. I am still afraid of just sitting in an interview because of the lack of confidence and knowledge about DSA. I personally do not think a good knowledge of DSA automatically guarentees a good developer. DSA, atleast the concepts asked/grilled around in the interviews never actually come across in a day to day work situation.

I no longer want to be afraid of attending a DSA interview, no longer want to just fake my way through a DSA discussion, no longer want to feel like an imposter because I am not really good at DSA. I am attempting to learn DSA concepts thoroughly by grinding on it daily and documenting the process and my honest thoughts on each of the concepts as I go through them. Stay tuned for more updates on my learning journey of a person learning DSA in depth after 4 years of work experience.
