## Definition

Democracy is defined as a form of government in which people have the authority to choose their legislation.

## Theory

An unspoken rule of a democracy is the expectation that participants who are voting/electing have to common goal: for solving their problems. Mathematically this can be correlated to a simple game:
Suppose there are `n` players, a bowl with large number of balls is presented to the players. Each of them have to guess how many balls are present in the bowl. Now there are two ways this game can go:

- **If players actually try and guess the actual number of balls present:**

    This would be an ideal case where answer is closest to average of all answers given by players.

  - An ideal democracy is based on the assumption that all participants are voting/electing for a common goal: a better society.
- **If some/majority players deliberately guess the wrong number of balls present/guess a number which would sway the average to their favour:**

    In both of these scenarios the average is nowhere close to actual number of balls present.
  - Current state of democracies in the world involves participants deliberately voting for something that is not at all favourable to society's interests or the participants being swayed to vote for something which is completely opposite to the society's interests.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, it comes down to human nature. Systems currently in place have found ways to game human nature according to their own interests, which is preventing due diligence by participants involved. Hopefully, this reaches a saturation point and something new comes on the horizon.
